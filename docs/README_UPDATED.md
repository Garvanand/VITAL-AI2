- Fallback to curated static recipe data when API is unavailable
- Image selection from a curated set of high-quality food photography

### User Interface

- Dedicated cuisine selector to focus on Indian recipes
- Special filters for Indian cuisine (spice levels)
- Visual indicators for spice levels using chili pepper emojis
- Responsive design that works across desktop and mobile devices

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallback to static recipes when API fails
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting
- Loading indicators during API calls
- Refresh button to try different recipe variations
